## WorldTimeAPI-compatible routes

### Routes

The client covers all 12 routes of the WorldTimeAPI-compatible contract ([`openapi/openapi-worldtimeapi.yaml`](https://github.com/TimeLogic-API-LLC/timelogic-api-sdks/blob/main/openapi/openapi-worldtimeapi.yaml)). Each JSON route has a plain-text twin ending in `.txt`.

| Route | Returns |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/timezone`, `/api/timezone.txt` | Every zone name. |
| `GET /api/timezone/{area}`, `.txt` | The zone names in an area such as `Europe`, or the time object for a one-word zone such as `UTC`. |
| `GET /api/timezone/{area}/{location}`, `.txt` | The time object for a zone such as `Europe/London`. |
| `GET /api/timezone/{area}/{location}/{region}`, `.txt` | The time object for a three-part zone such as `America/Argentina/Salta`. |
| `GET /api/ip`, `/api/ip.txt` | The time object for the caller's IP address. |
| `GET /api/ip/{ip}`, `.txt` | The time object for an IPv4 or IPv6 address. |

Zone names match in any letter case. Query parameters other than `api_key` and `sign` are ignored.

### Time object fields

| Field | Example | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `abbreviation` | `GMT` | Zone abbreviation. |
| `client_ip` | `203.0.113.7` | The caller's IP address. |
| `datetime` | `2026-11-01T13:18:00.721000+00:00` | Local time with six fractional digits (millisecond resolution, so the last three are `000`). |
| `day_of_week` | `0` | 0 = Sunday ... 6 = Saturday. |
| `day_of_year` | `305` | 1-366. |
| `dst` | `false` | Whether DST is in effect. |
| `dst_from` | `null` | Start of the current DST period, or `null`. |
| `dst_offset` | `0` | DST offset in seconds. |
| `dst_until` | `null` | End of the current DST period, or `null`. |
| `raw_offset` | `0` | Standard offset in seconds. |
| `timezone` | `Europe/London` | Zone name. |
| `unixtime` | `1793539080` | Unix seconds. |
| `utc_datetime` | `2026-11-01T13:18:00.721000+00:00` | UTC time. |
| `utc_offset` | `+00:00` | Current total offset. |
| `week_number` | `44` | ISO 8601 week number. |

The `.txt` variants return the same fields as `key: value` lines in alphabetical order.

### Errors and authentication

Unknown zones and malformed addresses return `404` with worldtimeapi.org's bodies: `{"error":"unknown location"}`, `{"error":"malformed ip"}` or `{"error":"not found"}` (on `.txt` routes, a line starting with `Error:`). Authentication and quota errors (`401`, `403`, `429`) use the TimeLogic error body shown in [Errors](#errors). Every route requires a TimeLogic API key, which the client sends as the `X-API-Key` header, and successful calls count toward the monthly quota like `/v1` calls. The client connects to the direct API (`https://api.timelogicapi.com` by default); it does not use the RapidAPI transport.

With signing enabled, the client adds `sign=true` and responses carry the same detached signature headers as `/v1` ([Signed responses](#signed-responses)); the body is byte-identical to the unsigned body. Use the raw request method to read those headers.
